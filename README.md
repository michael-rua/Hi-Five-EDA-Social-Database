# Knex Relationships

User stories for practicing with relational databases and related tools.


## Setup

Some of the setup for a sample application has already been done for you, but you still need to do these steps.

1. Install `knex` and `sqlite3` as normal dependencies.

2. Install `jest` and `supertest` as dev dependencies.

3. Apply the existing migrations that have already been created for you. This will create your database with an initial `users` table.

4. Add data to the database by applying the seed data.

5. Ensure the initial tests pass by running `npm test`.

6. You can start the server with nodemon using `npm run dev` and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Now you should be ready to complete the rest of this challenge.


## MVP

_As a user I want to click on a user's name and see their user profile page so that I can find out more about them._
 - This is a one to one relationship: a user _HAS ONE_ profile page.
 - You'll need a `profiles` table with a `user_id` column and some other useful information about the user, like their URL and maybe a profile picture.

_As an administrator I want to add a new user and their profile information so that I can grow my user base._
 - This will involve writing to more than one table in separate queries.
 - You should create a form to enter the user information, and a route which will be the form's action.

_As a user I want to create a blog post so that I can express myself._
  - This is a one to many relationship: a user _HAS MANY_ blog posts.
  - You'll need a `posts` table with a `user_id` column, and some named `title` and `content` that contain the post text.

_As a user I want to view a list of all blog posts for each user so that I can see what others have been writing._

_As a user I want to view a single blog post so that I can read it._


## Stretch

_As a user I want to add another user to my favourites list so that I can easily view their profile pages._
 - This is a many to many relationship: MANY users HAVE MANY favourites.
 - You'll need a `favourites` join table which has `user_id` and `favourite_id` columns.
 - Think about how you're going to add rows to this table as users add favourites to their list.

_As a user I want to filter the list of blog posts so that it only shows users who are on my favourites list._
